## AnimDessin2 & AnimCouleur2 for CS6


### Photoshop Scripts & Panels for Animation
This Section on GitHub contain the Manual installer of my Photoshop CS6 Extensions dedicated to cel-animation (frame-by-frame):
* **AnimDessin2:** This panel is designed for Photoshop CS6. It allows you to draw frame-by-image animations (cel-animation like), simplifying the process. it also lets you test the movie and set the duration of a keyframe…
* **AnimCouleur2:** This panel is available for Photoshop CS6. It allows you to simplify the process of coloring frame-by-image drawing animations created with "AnimDessin2".

The 2 **ZXP files** are the **Installers** of **AnimDessin2** and **AnimCouleur2**.
* Actually, **these Installers are the up-to-date versions of AnimDessin2** and **AnimCouleur2**.
* I didn't had the time yet to fix the Addons Portal versions here!

### Disclaimer
**I don't maintain anymore the installer of the Photoshop CS6** version of AnimDessin and AnimCouleur because my process to package/sign the extension doesn't work anymore.

So, try first the "Photoshop CS6 Installer" process and – if it doesn't work – please try the Workarounds.
